## Introduction
Airlines Delay Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting flight delays. Delays in flights can cause significant inconvenience to passengers and airlines alike. By predicting potential delays, airlines can manage their schedules better and passengers can plan their travels more efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [source name or link]. It includes historical flight data with features such as departure time, arrival time, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.

## Features
- **Flight Information**: Airline, flight number, departure and arrival airports, scheduled departure and arrival times.
- **Weather Data**: Weather conditions at departure and arrival airports.
- **Historical Data**: Previous delays for the same flight, average delays for the route, etc.

## Model
The project uses several machine learning models to predict flight delays, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

## Results
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
